Class 1 -

BDD - behavioral driven development -
	Given
	When
	And
	Then
We use BDD scenarios - to give a clear understanding to other colleagues in the team


To write the BDD scenarios in cucumber - we use special type of file

User story 12345 - Search an employee

Search by id
Given user navigates to HRMS application
When user enters valid username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user navigates to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee information button
When user enters employee id
And user clicks on search button
Then user see employee information is displayed

Search by name
Given user navigates to HRMS application
When user enters valid username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user navigates to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee information button
When user enters valid employee name
And user clicks on search button
Then user see employee information is displayed

Class 2 -

Recap -
      BDD - It allows us to write scenarios in gherkin language

      Feature - User story
      Scenario - Test case - every test case will be considered as scenario in BDD
      Given - pre-requisite/pre-condition
      When - perform actions
      Then - Expected output
      And - Supporting tag

      Step definition - Cucumber provides you the snippet of step definition
      In step definition, we write the code to perform actions which has been written in
      the BDD statement

      To execute all the feature files from one class, we need runner class

To keep everything organised we need framework -
Framework allows you to write simplified and organised code and
it provides folder to structure which is easily understandable

In framework we have 2 separate branches for
Java -  In java, we write all java classes
Non - Java - In non-java, we write non java part such as features, files etc
steps package - for all step definitions
runners package - for all runner classes
config directory - for all config files
features directory - for all feature files

Class 3 -
    Recap - BDD - Behavioral driven development
    because the explanation part was available in diagram

Class 4 -
    Recap -
    Runner class - Cucumber options in runner class
    features - to run the feature file, we provide a path to its repository
    glue - the path of our step definitions package
    dryRun - if we set it to true, it stops actual execution and scans all the steps quickly
    and provide us missing step definition
    monochrome - to remove irrelavant information from the console
    plugin - pretty - to print the steps in the console
    tags - to group the scenario for specific type of execution


POM - page object model - it is a design pattern

it allows QA's to keep object repository -
in simple language, QA's write all the locators of the page in respective class

LoginPage -
DashboardPage -


Class 5 -
        Recap - runner class - to run our test cases as per the requirement
                                to generate missing steps
                                to print the steps into the console
                                to generate the report

        Page object model - to have organised code and easy to maintain structure
        according to it, we create separate class (page) according to the
        screens available in the application and keep all the locators of this page
        in it

Hooks - we write pre condition and post condition using hooks in cucumber
    @Before - pre condition needs to be mentioned in this
    @After - post condition needs to be mentioned in this

Rules - Hooks class must be created inside steps package

Background - it is applicable only for one feature file
             it means for every feature file background will be different
             steps which are common among all the scenarios of that featur file
             will be taken into background but make sure the flow is not broken.
             if the flow breaks, then we cannot take steps in background after that


Hooks VS background

Hooks are applicable for whole project (for all the feature files)
Background is applicable for one feature file and varies from file to file
First Hooks execute then background execute then scenario execute

Class 6 -
    Recap -
        Page object model with page initializer class
        in this initializer class, we initialize all the objects of page classes and
        call the method in common methods class in openbrowser method

    We created a collection point in steps classes -
    -- methods call from common method, locators call from respective page classes using
       object of that class

    Background - same steps in feature file among all the scenarios should be a part of it
    Hooks - Pre condition and Post condition for the entire project
    here we use 2 hooks - @Before and @After

    Parameterization testing
    -- we can one add employee using feature file - 'instead of passing hardcoded data,
    we pass values inside the scenario such as "abc" , "xyz" etc'

    -- to increase the scope of testing, we use data driven testing concept
    instead of scenario, we use scenario outline with examples table
    -- in examples table, we pass multiple data sets using keys and values


Data table -
     it allows us to pass multiple sets of data without executing background

Outline - Examples table - hooks and background execute every time as per the data set
Scenario - Data table - hooks and background execute just one time

Working with excel
.xls - HSSF
.xlsx - XSSF


Class 7 -
   Recap - parameters passing for adding the employee
   -- earlier approach was - hardcoded data
   -- passing one set of data from feature file
   -- scenario outline - examples table (for passing multiple data sets)
   -- data table - hooks, background execute one time for multiple data sets
   -- excel - to pass large volume of data

cucumber accepts array of byte for screenshots
when we generate any report, this should be under target folder

how to open the report -
right click - open in - browser - chrome


Class - 8
    Recap -
    screenshot method - in cucumber it accept array of byte
    to get the unique screenshot name, we have implemented timestamp method
    we used Scenario class of cucumber to get the details  of execution
    to generate report - we use html plugin from runner class
    reports always generate in target folder
    we execute our code from pom.xml file, to achieve this we have used
    maven surefire plugin

    maven cucumber reporting plugin we use to get more detailed and colorful report

Log files - when we execute our code, we need to sharpen our debugging skills
          to have quick information about every step of execution, we need messages in the
          form of report.
          To get the details added by us, we need to create log files.
          To create this log file, we use log4j concept

maven lifecycle -
        compile - source code converts into binary code
        package - code will be packaged into jar files
        install - jars will be installed to local repo .m2
        deploy - here jars will go to remote repo
        test - code will be tested in this lifecycle
        clean - this will clean your target folder


        when you run test -
        this will execute compile - install - deploye - test

Database Testing:

1. Created database utility:
    1. to get object of resulset
    2. to get object of resultsetmetadata
    3. to retrieve data from resultset and store in ListOfMaps

Now we can write test cases:
1. feature file
2. write steps in step definition

finally {

            try {
                if (statement != null) {
                    statement.close();
                }
                if (conn != null) {
                    conn.close();
                }
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

API NOTES FROM CLASS 1

Class 1  -

API - Application programming interface

Client - the one who send the request
server - the one who respond to the request
API - communicates in between client and server
Request - send by client (information asked)
Response - (Answer from the server/DB)



Presentation layer - it is front-end/UI which we see on the screen
Application layer/Business layer - it is a layer where the logic of the application has been written
Data layer - it is the layer where data exists or we call it Database


Client - Server architecture



presentation layer - client exist


Application layer - logic exist of the application
Data layer - data exist



1 - tier architecture
when presentation layer, application layer, data layer available at one place, we call it 1 - tier architecture.

examples = calculator, MS word, MS paint, desktop based application/ standalone application.

2 - tier architecture

when the presentation layer is available at client end and the application and data layer is available at server end, we call it 2-tier architecture.
pizza hut, dominos, subway, walmart, starbucks etc

3 tier - architecture

when the presentation layer is available at client end
application layer is available at another end
and data layer is availablae at third end

example - JD parts, local bank, syntax hrm




n-tier architecture

presentation layer
application layer
data layer

example - Amazon, FB, IG, Twitter etc


Class 2 -
   recap --


client - server architecture
1 tier
2 tier
3 tier
n tier architecture





Why do we need API?

-- to make the systems developed in different languages communicate

-- to maintain the security of the data among the applications



Details we need to perform api testing


the location of api - end point

End point - it helps us in getting specific information from bunch of information





Web services -

API's which are hosted over the internet are called web services


every web services is an API by-default


why do we need to test -
to find the glitch in the system



2 types of web services -

REST - representational state transfer
SOAP - simple object access protocol

SOAP is more secured but slow
REST is fast


90% REST -

we will learn and work with REST API



Documents we need to perform testing
 for UI - SRS - software requirement specification
 for API - swagger





API location - end point

examples - 01/12/2023
Address - specific item
Airline-specific flight
amazon - specific type of user

Base URI - uniform resource identifier
URL - uniform resource locator
End point -

Base URI - uniform resource identifier (API exact location to fetch the details)
End point - to get specific information from group of information


Base URI - URL + endpoint



HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol

it is a protocol which allows websites to communicate over the internet


some basic methods of http, we need to follow

C - POST
R - GET
U - PUT
D - DELETE


First request -

To create ADMIN user into the system

Base URI - Base URL + end point


Base URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/createUser.php

payload/body - here we send the data which we need to add in the database

JSON - key and value, we use JSON format to send the payload/body

Body -

{
  "name": "batch14",
  "email": "batch14@test.com",
  "password": "Test@123"
}

content type - application/json
TYPE of request - POST




expected status code - 201 for post


Class 3 -

recap -

What is webservices -

Rest
Soap

Rest -

HTTP -

it has some methods to perform specific operations

C - create - POST
R - retrieve - GET
U - update - PUT
D - delete - DELETE

Example of the house - for Base URI

base url
endpoiint

base URI = base URL + end point

Swagger - developer provide this document

POST METHOD -

To prepare the request -

Base URI -
Body/payload - available in json format (key and value)
Type of method - POST
content-type - application/json


Response - 201 status code


POSTMAN -

in the body, provide all the keys which are available in swagger document, DONT DELETE/ADD any additional key



2 types of API -

Public API -
Private API -


john - 9.19, how people hack the system,I NEED TO ANSWER THIS TODAY ITSELF AND GIVE AN EXAMPLE FOR ANTON 9.20



API keeps the security
HOW -

process of authentication and authorization

We will work mainly with private API -




in private API's we have 2 types of application

Stateful application -

it is the application where the state of the server memory is true

this application stores the session id in server memory
every time a user makes a request, he has to send the credentials but if it is stored in server memory, he
doesn't need to provide this details

examples - amazon, instagram, facebook etc

Stateless application -

when the state of the server memory is false, it is stateless application
everytime response will be passed to the client/user in terms of token

statless is more secure than stateful application



CREATE A REQUEST TO GENERATE A TOKEN

base URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/generateToken.php

Type of method - POST

payload/body -

{
  "email": "batch14@test.com",
  "password": "Test@123"
}

content-type - application/json



response - 200 status code

json web token
JWT

eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.
eyJpYXQiOjE2NzM3MTc3NjIsImlzcyI6ImxvY2FsaG9zdCIsImV4cCI6MTY3Mzc2MDk2MiwidXNlcklkIjoiNDcyNSJ9.
Uh63_U2VrxNsEzbdsN0wBrQNbha2zZ_y0ngI449WMCs

JWT token has 3 parts

Header - type of token, algorithm used to create the token
Payload - issuer, issue time, expiry time, id
signature - same message has been conveyed to the client

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so far, we have created an admin user and generated a token which we will use to perform CRUD operations

CREATE A NORMAL EMPLOYEE

Base URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/createEmployee.php

type of method - post

payload/body -

{
  "emp_firstname": "sara",
  "emp_lastname": "bou",
  "emp_middle_name": "ms",
  "emp_gender": "F",
  "emp_birthday": "2011-01-12",
  "emp_status": "confirmed",
  "emp_job_title": "QA Engineer"
}

headers -
content-type = application/json


token -

JWT token has 3 types - bearer, MAC, grants


THUMB RULE -

After create an employee
cross check it in API

After updating the employee
cross check it in API

after deleting the employee
cross check it in API







possible cases

either database has not added gender

database has added it but api for create an employee is not able to show it here


GET ONE EMPLOYEE -

Base URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/getOneEmployee.php
type of method - GET


query parameter -

employee_id 45987A

header - content-type - application/json

token

in case if you are working with stateful application, then provide basic auth instead of bearer token


Class 4 -

Recap -


2 types of API -

public
private


in private API -

authorization and authentication

who are you
are you allowed?
show your id
what access you have


Stateful application -

stateless application -

JWT - json web token

- header, payload, signature


- bearer, MAC, grants




Get job titles

Type of request - GET

Base URI = hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/jobTitle.php

Authorization - token


Update employee -

Type of method - PUT


Base URI = hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/updateEmployee.php


{
  "employee_id": "46151A",
  "emp_firstname": "string",
  "emp_lastname": "string",
  "emp_middle_name": "string",
  "emp_gender": "Enter M for male or F for female",
  "emp_birthday": "2023-01-15",
  "emp_status": "string",
  "emp_job_title": "string"
}



Partial employee details update

Type of request - PATCH
Base URI = hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/updatePartialEmplyeesDetails.php

{
  "employee_id": "46151A",
  "emp_birthday": "2000-01-12"
}

header - content-type

authorization - token



in put we get 200 - it replaces whole data and not adding anything new
in patch we get 201 because we add a patch here in the existing data


Delete an employee


Type of request - Delete

Base uri =  hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api​/deleteEmployee.php

employee_id


cookies - it is a small block of code created by a web server while a user is browsing a website or application
on the computer, it is saving the activity.


why cookies use?

track your information  - for advertisement purpose
remeber your information



in house API - for internal use
third party API - for selling purpose





DEV
QA
STAGING
PRODUCTION


Test case

create an employee
get the created employee
verify it
update the employee
get the updated employee
update partial details of the employee
get this employee



Tests has been written in Javascript language


while calling the method when we use snippet, here pm stands for postman object


here we use chai assertion library from where we call our test

whatever comes with ? we call them query parameter
whatever comes with / we call them path parameter

Class 5 -

recap -

Json format we use to convert response body into json format
to extract/retrieve any specific value from the body we need this json object
to verify the specific value of the key in response body, we need json object

NOTE: we can verify the values and keys without json as well, but if client is needed we need to write functions/method to perform some additional verification

pre- request scripts can also be written under test as having one place to write all types of functions is easy to maintain
sometimes, we get ready made snippet from the postman, however sometimes, we need to write specific functions to fulfill the requirement

pm.expect is the method you use to verify any property/attribute/key/value from the response


Task -

Write a test

IN GENERATE TOKEN REQUEST, PLEASE WRITE THESE TESTS

verify the status code is 200
print the body of the response in json format
verify the body containes key 'token'



pm.expect - to verify
function() - to specify the method in java
pm.test - to write the test

pm.test("printing the response json body", function(){
    const jsonFormat = JSON.parse(responseBody)
    console.log(jsonFormat)
})

console.log - to print something in the console
const - it is a variable which is used to store values
"name" - it is used to provide function name




pm.test("Our batch 14 own function", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status("OK");
});


pm.test("Verifying the response", function(){
    pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include("token");
})


REST Assured -


Rest assured is a DSL (Domain specific language)


it is a java library used to automate API's


Rest assured follows behavioral driven development BDD

in cucumber

Given - pre condition
When - perform actions
Then - expected output/ assertions/ verifications

in rest assured API

given - prepare the request

when - making the request/sending the request/ hitting the endpoint

then - verfying/assertions/expected results


rest web service allows us to send/receive data in json format which contains key value pair


Class 6 -

Recap -


	how to write our own function in postman -

	pm - postman
	test - to perform assertions


pm.expect - validation/verification

JSON - const abc = JSON.parse(responseBody)


Automation of API - we use cucumberBatch14 project for this (NOTE: WE DONT USE GROUP PROJECT IN THE CLASS)



rest assured -

supports BDD approach -

given - prepare request
when - to hit the end point
then - verifying the response


base URI = base uri


Hamcrest matchers.

it is a class that contains methods to perform assertions

JsonPath - class
jsonPath() - it is function/method belongs to JsonPath class


Class 7 -
recap --
    Rest assured API -
    DSL - domain specific language
    it allows us to send/receive data in json format

    base uri = base url

    rest assured api follows BDD approach
    given - to prepare the request
    when - send the request/ hitting the end point
    then - assertion/verification

    to prepare the request -
    RequestSpecification - we use to prepare the request
    Response - to store the response body after hitting the end point

    along with given, we provide headers, query parameters, body etc to prepare
    the request as per the type of method (get, POST)

    JSONPath - class
    jsonPath() - to provide the functionality of assertions

    Hamcrest matchers - for assertions we use

    we use @Test annotation from junit to run all the test cases
    but, to execute them alphabatically, we use FixMethodOrder.


    C - created the employee
    R - retrieved the created employee
    U - updated the employee
    R - retrieved updated employee
    D - we didn't use it because of the talent of batch 14


under steps package, we have hooks, when we write our steps for API under it,
hooks will execute, we don't want to execute hooks for API since hooks are for UI

in generate token steps class, we have written the method for generating the token

Class 8 -

recap -
    - integrated (added)Rest assured with cucumber
    - to add rest assured we added feature file
    - then API steps package, we dont want to execute hooks
    - to generate token automatically everytime, we implemented a class
    - API runner class to run only API test cases
    - API constant class to pass all the constants of the API
    - API Payload constant class to pass the body/payload

NOW TALK ABOUT OPERATIONS:::::

C - we wrote a scenario for creating the employee and verify it
R - retrieved the created employee and verify it

We will do
U - update the employee and we will verify it

After performing the operations, we identified one more need to
pass body/payload in easy format, so we implemented JSON format in APIPayload constant class

HOMEWORK --- HOMEWORK -- HOMEWORK -- HOWEWORK -- HOMEWORK --

update the existing employee details - PUT
and verify the data - GET
